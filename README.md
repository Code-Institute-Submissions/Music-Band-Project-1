## Some of the limitations encountered on the way to project finalisation:
- Version control in GitHub:
	- The initial commit was successfully executed
	- However, no further commits could be pushed to GitHub depository except for the files pushed under git push "--force" tag 
	- The latest versions of the code had to be deployed via manual editing of the files  
- Markdown:
	- The README file creation was delayed due to MP constantly crushing in Windows 10
	- The problem was resolved working on another computer with previous version of Windows installed  
- Some force major issues occurred during project execution
